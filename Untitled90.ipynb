    "Batch Size and Training Dynamics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Batch Sizes: Training with large batch sizes can lead to faster convergence during training since more samples are processed in parallel before updating the model parameters. However, large batch sizes require more memory and computational resources, which may limit their applicability on hardware with limited resources.\n",
    "Small Batch Sizes: Training with small batch sizes can introduce more noise into the parameter updates since each batch contains fewer samples. As a result, training with small batch sizes may require more iterations to converge, but it can lead to better generalization since the noise can act as a form of regularization.\n",
    "Effect on Model Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Batch Sizes: Using large batch sizes can sometimes lead to poorer generalization performance, especially on smaller datasets. This is because large batch sizes may cause the model to converge to sharp minima in the loss landscape, which can result in overfitting. Additionally, large batch sizes may limit the exploration of the parameter space, preventing the model from finding better solutions.\n",
    "Small Batch Sizes: Training with small batch sizes can result in better generalization performance, as it allows the model to explore a larger portion of the parameter space and avoid sharp minima. However, training with small batch sizes can be computationally expensive and may require more training iterations to achieve convergence.\n",
    "Trade-offs:\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of batch size involves a trade-off between computational efficiency, training dynamics, and model performance.\n",
    "Larger batch sizes are computationally efficient but may lead to poorer generalization and convergence to suboptimal solutions.\n",
    "Smaller batch sizes can improve generalization and convergence behavior but may require more computational resources and time.\n",
    "To observe the effect of different batch sizes on the training dynamics and model performance, you can perform the following experiments:\n",
    "\n",
    "Train the neural network model using different batch sizes (e.g., 32, 64, 128, 256).\n",
    "Monitor training and validation loss curves during training to observe convergence behavior.\n",
    "Evaluate the trained models on a held-out test dataset to assess generalization performance.\n",
    "Compare training time, convergence behavior, and generalization performance across different batch sizes."
